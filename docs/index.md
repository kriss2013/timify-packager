## Welcome

You want to build reliable apps for the TIMIFY eco system on top of TIMIFY's  API? Then you are exactly at the right place here.

TIMIFY Developer Kit for Node.js will help you building TIMIFY apps fast & easy. This library will help you build on all aspects of the TIMIFY platform, from sending email notification to integrations with third party softwares.

We are developing our API constantly and we are adding more and more features to it.

## Requirements

Of course, you'll need Node.js, as well as NPM. NPM has
[a great tutorial](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to help you get started if you don't have
these tools installed.

To install, you will first want to create a new Node.js project. The simplest way is to use your computer's terminal app
to invoke

```bash
npm init
```

This script will prompt you to describe the app you are going to build, and create a file that NPM can use to help
manage your project.

Once you have a working project, you can install {{ site.product_name }} as a dependency by invoking

```bash
npm install @slack/client --save
```

Once you've installed {{ site.product_name }} as a dependency you can start using it in your code. Look at
[Basic Usage](basic_usage.html) to get started.
